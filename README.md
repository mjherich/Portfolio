# Lambda Portfolio

A portfolio showcasing my skills and projects I've worked on at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). Built in React with Material UI.

## Self-Hosted on a Raspberry Pi

I learned how to manage an nginx server and enable SSL with Let's Encrypt while deploying this project. Utilized [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/) for a dynamic hostname that I could point to with a CNAME record. Site can be accessed via [portfolio.mattherich.com](https://portfolio.mattherich.com/).
