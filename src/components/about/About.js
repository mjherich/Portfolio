            I have a long history of working for myself and building my own businesses. In high school and throughout college I repaired/modded Xbox 360 game consoles and was quite successful!
            Later on in life I got into the digital marketing game and co-founded a digital agency focused on helping local service providers build their online presence. I'm incredibly proud of what my co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlewisweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Lewis</a> and I were able to accomplish during this endeavor.

            I've been building custom PC's for a decade and currently run a Ryzen 5 2600 @ 4.2GHz / GTX 2060 main tower with a 2015 Macbook Pro companion. Over the last 9 months at Lambda School I've continued to hone my workstation into what it is today. The Autonomous.ai standing desk allows me to work throughout the day at my computer without feeling locked down in my chair. I'll typically switch from sitting to standing several times throughout the day and it makes for a much more enjoyable work environment.
